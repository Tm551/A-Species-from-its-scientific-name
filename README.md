# A species from its scientific name
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to enter that name to get some clue about specific characteristics of the species, such as morphology, geographic distribution, or discoverer. Two words that can give us some clues to start a search. The scientific name as the first entry to know the chosen species of interest. In this case, native South American tree species at risk of extinction


## Background

It solves problems of species identification, sometimes very similar in many cases with a simple name obtained from bibliography.
In certain university courses or even in schools, it can be useful as a method of learning about species. It can become a big challenge trying to find specific characteristics of species and the program helps with that, along with familiarization with scientific names. 
As a graduate of a degree related to environmental sciences, I find it necessary to simplify topics such as species nomenclature.


Sources that will be used for the operation



## How is it used?

To learn about tree species and taxonomy, choose a scientific name of interest and enter it. The program will respond with species characteristics that will be compared with reality.





## Data sources and AI methods
Data of Kew Gardens https://powo.science.kew.org/
Data of Global Biodiversity Information Facility https://www.gbif.org/




## Challenges

In the case of many species, the program is of no use because many species were named with words that had no or very little relation to the tree, such as names of kings of the time or even friends of the discoverer.

## What next?

It's good that users contribute information. First, about names that don't work for the program and can be archived so they're not used in new searches.
